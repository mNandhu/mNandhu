# Hi there! I'm Kiruthik 👋

I'm a student who loves to build, break, and occasionally fix things with AI. My goal? To have fun and see what's possible when you combine code with a little bit of curiosity.

## 🚀 What I'm All About
-   **I enjoy tinkering with:** AI/ML, System Design, and building robust APIs.
-   **Why I do it:** Sounds interesting.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox
-   **My trusty sidekick:** Python
-   **Weapons from a past life:** Java, C, MATLAB, JavaScript

## 📂 My Coding Journey
Here's a look at my projects in reverse chronological order. It's a story that starts with simple scripts and builds up to the complex systems I'm passionate about today.

### ⚔️ On the Cutting Edge
These are my current obsessions, where I'm pooling all my experience in AI, API handling, and system design.
-   [**PACE**](https://github.com/mNandhu/PACE): A Context Engineering Engine for Roleplaying LLMs.
-   [**Hestia**](https://github.com/mNandhu/Hestia): A personal server manager to rule all your self-hosted services from one simple, clean interface.
-   [**Tagify**](https://github.com/mNandhu/Tagify): AI-tagging powered Gallery for Organizing AI Generated images (ComfyUI)

### 🚀 In the Spotlight
My most recent and polished creations.
-   [**LLM-on-Wheels**](https://github.com/mNandhu/LLM-on-Wheels): LangGraph-powered LLM bot simulation.
-   [**Evalify**](https://github.com/evalify/): My work focused on the backend FastAPI App (`DescEval`), the evaluator in this scalable exam proctoring platform powered by rq.
-   [**BlockPicker**](https://github.com/mNandhu/BlockPicking): Just picking up blocks, but with a $1000 robotic hand with a camera for eyes.

### 🔥 Gaining Momentum
Projects where I started hitting my stride and exploring more complex ideas.
-   [**ZeroCarbonLLM**](https://github.com/mNandhu/ZeroCarbonLLM): RAG Powered LLM for Carbon Capture Research.
-   [**Student Management Website**](https://github.com/SrimanRakshan/DSA): A Beginner Level project for learning Django, DSA and OOPs
-   **StudyTracker**: CrewAI-Based Multi-Agentic Framework for AI-Assisted Learning

### 🌱 Where It All Began
My first steps into the world of code. They aren't fancy, but they're the foundation of everything I've learned since!
-   [**MAL-APIClient**](https://github.com/mNandhu/MAL-APIClient): My second repo ever! This is where I first learned the ropes of handling APIs, a skill I now use in production apps.
-   **Retinal Imaging and Disease Prediction**
-   **Follow-Me Drone**: Raspberry Pi-powered drone with rudimentary person-following
-   **Hand-Following Bot**: A Very Basic Arduino Project
